# R-Programming


This project demonstrates various data manipulation techniques using R. The dataset used is worms.txt, which contains information about different farms and their worm densities, soil pH levels, and vegetation types. Below are some of the key tasks performed in this project:

Key Tasks
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into R as a data frame for easy manipulation.

Row and Column Selection: Selected specific rows and columns from the dataset to create new data frames.

Data Export: Saved a filtered version of the data as a CSV file for further use.

Data Filtering: Applied conditions to filter the data based on vegetation types and soil pH levels.

Sampling: Randomly sampled data points from the dataset for analysis.

Statistical Analysis: Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for numeric columns in the dataset.

Data Sorting: Sorted the data based on area and worm density to analyze trends.

Adding New Data: Added a new row of data to the existing data frame.

Requirements
R and RStudio

How to Run
Load the dataset into your R session.
